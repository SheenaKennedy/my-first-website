# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my first live website.

## Technologies used:
This web project was created using primarily HTML5 and CSS3, as part of the curriculum of Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.
The different Stream Pages visually illustrate the subjects covered and implemented in the different sections of the course.
The original structure and style formatting were created using Cloud9. 
It was later moved to and edited in the Gitpod IDE, and backed up to a remote repository using Git and GitHub.

## Contents:
- This ReadMe file to outline the website project,
- For added security purposes it includes an untracked password file which is stored in a separate file formatted for Git to ignore when working in the command line,
- A CSS styling file,
- and 3 interconnected pages, accessible through menu links at the top of each page.
Menu:
    1) Stream One (index.html)
    2) Stream Two
    3) Stream Three

- The content of each page are 6 image logos and names of different software/languages that I will have mastered upon completion of my course at Code Institute.
- Each logo image and title are clickable, and will redirect the user to a corresponding Wikipedia link for information on that specific software/language.
- All link redirects will open in a new tab so user can return to where they had left off on this site.
- All the images of varying original dimensions and their corresponding titles were styled to be identical in size, as well as being responsive. 


Responsive Web Design
- to be implemented soon.
